Project Overview
This project analyzes data from a personal loan campaign to understand customer profiles and predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.
The analysis leverages data science techniques to extract actionable business insights and build predictive models that can help financial institutions
target the right customers, optimize marketing strategies, and improve campaign effectiveness.

This project is an example of supervised machine learning for binary classification, specifically focused on:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding customer demographics, account features, and loan acceptance patterns.
Feature Engineering: Preparing and transforming variables such as age, income, family size, credit card average spending, and online account usage.
Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict the likelihood of a customer accepting a personal loan.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Business Analytics: Translating model results into actionable recommendations for marketing and customer targeting.
